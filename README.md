### Task: Replace Negative Elements in an Array

The goal is to replace all negative elements in a memory array with 0, while leaving positive and zero elements unchanged.  

#### Logic Overview:
1. **Iterate Through the Array**:  
   Use a loop to traverse each element in the array sequentially.

2. **Check Element Value**:  
   - If an elementâ€™s value is less than 0, update it to 0.  
   - Otherwise, leave the element unchanged.  

3. **Address Calculation**:  
   Use an offset to calculate the memory address of each array element, ensuring every element is processed in order.

Initialization:
Start with the first element as the current maximum value.

Comparison:
Sequentially compare each subsequent element with the current maximum.

Update:
If a strictly larger value is found, update the current maximum and its index.
Skip the update if the current value is less than or equal to the maximum.
Termination:
Continue until all elements are checked. Return the index of the maximum value.

#### Initialization
- The maximum value (`t0`) is initialized with the first element.  
- The maximum index (`t1`) is set to 0.  
- The loop index (`t2`) starts at 1 to avoid re-checking the first element.

#### Loop Termination
- The loop continues as long as the loop index (`t2`) is less than the array length (`a1`).  
- When `t2` equals or exceeds `a1`, the loop ends with `bge t2, a1, loop_end`.

#### Element Address Calculation
- The offset for the current element is calculated as `t3 = t2 * 4` (since each element is 4 bytes).  
- The element's memory address is then determined by adding the offset to the base address (`a0`).

#### Element Loading and Comparison
- The current element is loaded into `t5` from memory.  
- The value in `t5` is compared with the current maximum (`t0`).  
  - If the current element is **less than or equal** to the maximum, the loop skips updating the maximum (`ble t5, t0, loop_continue`).

#### Update Maximum
- If a strictly larger value is found:
  - The maximum value (`t0`) is updated to the value in `t5`.  
  - The maximum index (`t1`) is updated to the current index (`t2`).

#### Loop Continuation
- The loop index (`t2`) is incremented, and the process repeats until all elements are processed.
