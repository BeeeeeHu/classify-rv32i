### Task: Replace Negative Elements in an Array

The goal is to replace all negative elements in a memory array with 0, while leaving positive and zero elements unchanged.  

#### Logic Overview:
1. **Iterate Through the Array**:  
   Use a loop to traverse each element in the array sequentially.

2. **Check Element Value**:  
   - If an elementâ€™s value is less than 0, update it to 0.  
   - Otherwise, leave the element unchanged.  

3. **Address Calculation**:  
   Use an offset to calculate the memory address of each array element, ensuring every element is processed in order.

Initialization:
Start with the first element as the current maximum value.

Comparison:
Sequentially compare each subsequent element with the current maximum.

Update:
If a strictly larger value is found, update the current maximum and its index.
Skip the update if the current value is less than or equal to the maximum.
Termination:
Continue until all elements are checked. Return the index of the maximum value.

Initialization:
Before entering the loop, the maximum value (t0) is initialized with the first element, and the maximum index (t1) is set to 0. The loop index (t2) starts at 1 to skip re-checking the first element.

Loop Termination:
The loop continues as long as the loop index (t2) is less than the array length (a1). When t2 equals or exceeds a1, the loop ends (bge t2, a1, loop_end).

Element Address Calculation:

The offset for the current element is calculated using t3 = t2 * 4 (word size in bytes).
The element's address is determined by adding this offset to the base address (a0).
Element Loading and Comparison:
The current element is loaded into t5. It is then compared with the maximum value (t0).

If the current element is less than or equal to t0, the loop skips updating the maximum (ble t5, t0, loop_continue).
Update Maximum:
If a strictly larger value is found, both the maximum value (t0) and its index (t1) are updated.

Loop Continuation:
The loop index (t2) is incremented, and the process repeats until all elements are processed.
