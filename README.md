### Task: Replace Negative Elements in an Array

The goal is to replace all negative elements in a memory array with 0, while leaving positive and zero elements unchanged.  

#### Logic Overview:
1. **Iterate Through the Array**:  
   Use a loop to traverse each element in the array sequentially.

2. **Check Element Value**:  
   - If an elementâ€™s value is less than 0, update it to 0.  
   - Otherwise, leave the element unchanged.  

3. **Address Calculation**:  
   Use an offset to calculate the memory address of each array element, ensuring every element is processed in order.
